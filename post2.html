        Dance has been in my life for as long as I can remember. I spent majority of my childhood preparing for and performing at concerts, festivals, competitions... even weddings! Dancing was not something I had anticipated consuming most of my life, but I would not trade it for the world.<br><br>
 
        Growing up, I was a shy little girl who only spoke when spoken to. Getting a conversation out of me was one of the hardest things to do. As soon as I stepped foot on the dance floor, all of the shyness shed like snake skin. I had found myself through the art of dance.<br><br>
        
        <b>Dance is an Escape</b><br>
        Dance allows you to move freely and think creatively. It takes the emotions you may feel on a daily basis and turns them into a physical art form -- one that can be seen, felt, and heard. Had it not been for dance, I would have years upon years of pent up emotions that I would not know how to cope with. I use dance to escape from the realities of life and create my own world. When I'm dancing, I have full control of what is happening and what is going to happen next.<br><br>
        
        <b>Improving Self-Control</b><br>
        Dance helps with self-control. When you dance, you are in complete control of your mind and body. You decide what you feel and how you would like to express that emotion to your audience. This process comes with a lot of self-awareness. It takes a lot of strength to decide when and where to show your emotions, and dance helps with controlling that.<br><br>
        
        <b>Communicating Emotion</b><br>
        Facial expressions play a major role in communicating emotion. Every emotion you feel translates into its own movement. You can display happiness by putting a smile on your face, or anger by furrowing your eyebrows. Movements can express emotion as well, though facial expressions are what ties it all together.<br><br>
        
        It is no doubt that dance creates a safe space for a lot of people, myself included. Dance can relieve tensions and release negative emotions in a healthy manner. Next time you need to "take a breather," try dancing!
